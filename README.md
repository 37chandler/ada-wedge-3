Repo for ADA Wedge project

Task 1: I followed Antonio's lead and uploaded the clean data manually via the buckets functionality in Google Storage. Tasks 2 and 3 are coded as expected in Python. 

Database file uploaded as zip because uncompressed file (at 106mb) is slightly larger than GitHub's max file size limit of 100mb.

## Feedback

Looks like I don't have "make changes" permissions, so here's a fork with feedback. 

### Part 1

There's nothing obviously wrong with that upload piece. Thanks for trying it. Were you able
to upload the smaller files? Having to do it both ways is actually good practice for real life.
(The impossible question is when to bail on the programmatic approach.) 

### Part 2

This all looks good. No need to print the sample to the screen. 

### Part 3

You have hypens and underscores in the name of this file. That kind of stuff can lead to weird bugs. Similarly,
the title case column names might be hard to remember in languages (like R and Python) where case matters. Good
to come up with standards and adhere to them. All the code looks spot on, though.

### Overall

Nice job. Consider this **complete**. Glad you got to the finish line, I know it was quite a journey.
